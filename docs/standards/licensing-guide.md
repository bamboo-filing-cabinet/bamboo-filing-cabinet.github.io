# Licensing guide

- Always include a license for code (MIT/Apache-2.0 are common).
- Do NOT claim a license the source doesn’t grant.
- If the source licensing is unclear, mark the data license as **UNKNOWN** and keep provenance strong.
- Prefer permissive licenses (e.g., CC0, CC-BY) for data.
- Avoid restrictive licenses (e.g., CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-ND) that limit reuse.
- When combining datasets, ensure license compatibility.
- Document licensing clearly in dataset metadata (e.g., dataset card).
- When in doubt, seek legal advice or consult licensing experts.
