# Contribute / Corrections

## Best way: GitHub Issues + PRs
- Corrections: open an Issue in the relevant dataset repo with source links + retrieval dates
- New datasets: open an Issue in the org describing sources + update frequency + expected outputs

## Alternate intake (anonymous)
If you prefer not to use GitHub, submit corrections, questions, or suggestions here:

## If you’re not sure where it belongs
Open an Issue in the repo that feels closest (or [in this repo](https://github.com/bamboo-filing-cabinet/bamboo-filing-cabinet.github.io/issues) for now) and we’ll route it.
